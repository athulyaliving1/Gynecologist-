                Woman’s health is paid attention to only during the reproductive
                age. But many are unaware of the geriatric gynecological
                problems women can face. This lack of awareness leads to serious
                problems. It’s better to get yourself checked on time.
                Management of gynecological problems in elderly women can be
                difficult when compared to younger women.
